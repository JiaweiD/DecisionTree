As disccussed in README, we can deal with discrete attributes by the decision tree algorithm. What if the atrribute has continous values?

We can use bi-partition to make continuous attributes discrete.
First, make up a set of splitting point:
                  Ta = {(a(i)+a(i+1))/2|1≤i≤n-1}     n = length(dataset)

Second, we can apply information gain on these points:
                  Gain(D,a) = max Gain(D,a,t)     t∈Ta
                            = max Ent(D) - ΣDtλ/D*Ent(Dtλ)     t∈Ta
                            
Then, the t in Ta that makes Gain(D,a) the largest is the splitting point of the continuous attribute.
